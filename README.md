# Student-Database-and-Report-Card-Generator

This project focuses on creating a streamlined solution for managing and retrieving student details using a CSV-based backend using python and pandas and an intuitive GUI built with Tkinter. It handles student records, including name, enrollment number, marks in 5 subjects, total marks, average marks, and the pass/fail status.

## **Key Features:**

### CSV Integration:
      A well-structured CSV file serves as the database, storing student details in an organized manner for quick and easy access.

### Student Verification: 
      The system verifies student details by matching the name and enrollment number provided by the user against the records in the CSV file.

### Detailed Report Card Generation:
      If a match is found, the system generates and displays a comprehensive report card, including:      
            Name            
            Enrollment Number            
            Marks scored in each subject            
            Total Marks            
            Average Marks
            Pass/Fail Status.            
      The report card is presented in a user-friendly format through the Tkinter interface.

### Error Handling:
      If the entered name or enrollment number does not match any record, the system displays a clear error message, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### User-Friendly GUI:
      Designed with Tkinter, the graphical user interface ensures easy navigation and interaction.
      Users can enter details and retrieve results seamlessly through an interactive layout.

## **Technology Stack:**

Frontend: Tkinter for GUI.
Backend: Python for logic handling and CSV file operations.
